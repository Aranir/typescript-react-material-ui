# Webpack React with Material-UI (v1.0) using Typescript


This is a simple boilerplate which allows to use webpack as a package bundler with react
and Material-UI (v1.0) as the UI Framework.

Typescript is used for the implementation as well as react-router.

## How to start?

- `$> yarn install`
- `$> webpack-dev-server`


Then go to `localhost:3000` and enjoy. Happy coding :)
